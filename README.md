# ClipboardToAHKScript
Makes your most recent clipboard text item a hardware event allowing you to copy into netlabs.

To use this script you download AutoHotKey and run then run the file clipboard.ahk on each 
subsequent system boot. I could add a task schedule setting batch to automate the ahk script 
on system startup if there is interest.

The default Hotkey is 'Ctrl + shift + d'
