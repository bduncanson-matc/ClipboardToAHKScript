# ClipboardToAHKScript
Purpose: To turn the most recent clipboard item(Your ctrl+v output) to
a hardware event driven paste. This allows a host to paste in to web 
based VM solutions.

### Dependencies:
AutoHotKey

### How to use
To use this script you download AutoHotKey(https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run then run the file 
clipboard.ahk which will make a hot key(Ctrl + Shift + d by default) that pastes your host clipboard paste item
a hardware event. The .ahk must script must be run on each system boot but could automate scheduling a task with
a batch script if there is interest.

Note(You can turn the script off from the tray in the bottom right corner of windows)
